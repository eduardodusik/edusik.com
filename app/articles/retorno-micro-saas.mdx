# How I Made My First $144 with My Micro-SaaS

<Callout type="info">
  If you've been following my journey, you might remember how I [first earned $20 from my Micro-SaaS](https://retorno.io/) almost by accident. This time, I want to share what happened in the **first month** after launching my MVP — and how it generated **$144 in revenue** (roughly BRL 815).

## Context: A Copilot for n8n

Back in September, I started researching the idea of building a "Copilot" for [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/). The idea was to help users generate workflows, respond to questions about their automations, and improve their flows more efficiently.

On **December 5**, I finally deployed my MVP into production. Before that, I had already collected emails from interested people using a simple landing page — the classic "Waitlist for Beta" approach.

## Launch and First Sales

On **December 7** (a Saturday), I sent an email to those early leads, letting them know the product was ready for testing.  
No sales came in that day. But on Sunday morning, I saw the **second sale** pop up from someone who had opened my email and decided to buy credits on the platform.

Later that Sunday, I sent out another email offering a **50% discount coupon** to encourage people to test it out. Over the course of the month, six more sales came in. The last one was on **January 6**, almost a full month after the initial announcement.

### What I Did

1. **Released the MVP** without a free tier.  
2. **Sent two emails** to my waitlist (one announcement, one discount).  
3. **Updated my Reddit post** where I first mentioned the product, saying it was now ready.

<Callout type="tip" title="Goals">
  I honestly expected **far less** traction. My main goals for this first month were:

  - **Validate demand**: Are people actually willing to pay for this solution?  
  - **Collect feedback**: Understand real usage, motivations, and how to improve the tool.  
  - **Identify the real audience**: Pinpoint who truly benefits from this, so I can focus on building the right features for them.
</Callout>

## Revenue and Disclaimer

Over that month, I made **$144** in sales.  
Here are a few extra notes:

1. **One refund** happened, so the gross vs. net difference appears in my Stripe reports.  
2. The "net" after Stripe fees is still not my true profit. Taxes and other costs will reduce it further.  
3. It's just the **first month**. I'll share more about finances, costs, and taxes in future posts once I have more data.

## Next Steps

I'm taking the feedback from these early adopters to refine the product. It's far from "finished," but the positive response so far confirms that there's real value for those looking to boost their n8n workflows.
