# Building a Modern Blog with Next.js and MDX

As a developer, I've always wanted to have my own space on the web where I could share my thoughts and experiences. After exploring various options, I decided to build my blog using Next.js and MDX, inspired by developers like [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.com/) who have created elegant, performant blogs using these technologies.

## Why Next.js and MDX?

Next.js has become my framework of choice for several reasons:

- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for images, fonts, and static generation
- **Dynamic Routes**: Easy to create blog posts using file-system based routing
- **SEO Friendly**: Excellent support for metadata and static generation
- **Developer Experience**: Great developer tools and hot reload

MDX adds another layer of power by allowing me to:
- Write content in Markdown
- Embed React components directly in my posts
- Use JavaScript expressions and dynamic content

## Setting Up the Blog

The setup process was surprisingly straightforward. First, I installed the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

Then, I configured Next.js to handle MDX files by updating my `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx']
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
  // Optional: Configure plugins here
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

## The Power of Metadata

One of the most powerful features is the metadata support. For each blog post, I can define metadata like this:

```javascript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'My Blog Post',
  description: 'An awesome post about tech',
  date: '2024-03-20'
}
```

This metadata serves multiple purposes:
- **SEO optimization**: Next.js automatically generates proper meta tags
- **Social sharing**: OpenGraph tags for better social media previews
- **Content organization**: Easy to sort and filter posts

## Dynamic Routes and Static Generation

Next.js's dynamic routing is perfect for blogs. I structured my posts like this:

```
app/
  blog/
    [slug]/
      page.tsx    // Dynamic route handler
  articles/
    first.mdx     // This post
    second.mdx    // Another post
```

The `generateStaticParams` function ensures all posts are pre-rendered at build time:

```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  // Get all post slugs
  return [
    { slug: 'first' },
    { slug: 'second' }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Benefits

By using Next.js's static generation:
- Pages are generated at build time
- Blazing fast page loads
- Great SEO scores
- Reduced server load

## Styling and Components

MDX lets me use React components right in my markdown, and I can use Tailwind CSS with the typography plugin for beautiful content styling. This gives me the flexibility to create rich, interactive content while maintaining a clean and professional look.

## Conclusion

Building a blog with Next.js and MDX has been a great experience. The combination provides:
- Excellent developer experience
- Great performance
- SEO optimization out of the box
- Flexibility to extend with React components

If you're thinking about creating a blog, I highly recommend this stack. The [official Next.js MDX documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) is an excellent resource to get started.
